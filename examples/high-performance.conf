# High-Performance Configuration
# Optimized for high-volume logging with minimal overhead

[Network]
# Use UDP for lowest overhead
# Consider multicast for broadcasting to multiple receivers
Address=192.168.1.100:514
Protocol=udp

# RFC 5424 is efficient and well-supported
LogFormat=rfc5424

# Performance optimizations:

# 1. Reduce retry delays (fail fast)
ConnectionRetrySec=5

# 2. If using TCP, enable these:
# NoDelay=yes          # Disable Nagle algorithm (send immediately)
# KeepAlive=no         # Disable keepalive overhead

# 3. Filter out verbose logs to reduce volume
ExcludeSyslogLevel=debug

# 4. Consider increasing send buffer size via drop-in:
#    [Manager]
#    SendBuffer=262144

# Notes:
# - UDP has no delivery guarantee but highest throughput
# - Monitor network for packet loss with: netstat -su
# - For extreme volumes, consider local aggregation with rsyslog first
